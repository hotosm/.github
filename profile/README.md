# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM)!

 ## :sunny: About HOTOSM 
We are dedicated to humanitarian action and community development through open mapping. We work together to provide map data which revolutionises disaster management, reduces risks, and contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Check our [website](https://www.hotosm.org/).


##  :sun_with_face: About HOT Tech and Innovation
We aim to create and nurture just tech to amplify connections between human[itarian] needs and open map data. We have a core tech team, but we rely on YOU for contributions and collaborations to make all this magic happen! 

## ðŸŒˆ How to Contribute
As with any open source community, there are many projects and tools that we are working on at the same time. You can see that reflected in the number of repositories we have. How to get started:
1. Check the 6 pinned repositories below- these are our current open source projects we are actively working on
2. Check the README file - you will see a reference to a product roadmap for the year that will give you an indication of the work we are doing
3. Read the contributing guidelines for each repo - we would advise starting with any issues labelled *Good First Issue*

Still unsure where to start your contributor journey, reach to our Open Tech Collective Facilitator- [Petya](https://github.com/petya-kangalova)
