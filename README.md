# Hi there üëã Welcome to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM)!

 ##  About HOTOSM 
We are dedicated to humanitarian action and community development through open mapping. We work together to provide map data which revolutionises disaster management, reduces risks, and contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Check our [website](https://www.hotosm.org/).


##  :sun_with_face: Who We are: Tech and Innovation
We aim to create and nurture just tech to amplify connections between human[itarian] needs and open map data. We have a core tech team, but we rely on YOU for contributions and collaborations to make all this magic happen! See our current team below.
